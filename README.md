# Civ6TranslationChecker

This tool has two goals:  
1. Check if any translations LOC_* used in BBG are missing translations  
2. Check if any languages in BBG are missing translations that are already in English  

## Usage:
```
$ sh loc_tool.sh -bbg "<path_to_bbg_mod>" --root "<path_to_steam_common>/Sid Meier's Civilization VI"
```
